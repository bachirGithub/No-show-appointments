# No-show-appointments
## Introduction
> This dataset collects information on 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil and focuses on whether or not patients show up for their appointments. A number of patient characteristics are included in each row.
‘ScheduledDay’ tells us what day the patient has scheduled their appointment. 'Neighborhood' indicates the location of the hospital. Scholarship indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in the Brazilian Bolsa Família wellness program. ‘No-show’ indicates “No” if the patient showed up for their appointment, and “Yes” if they did not show up.

> Thus in this analysis we will try to answer the following questions:

>> 1. Which age category shows up the least at meetings?
>> 2. Which of the patients, with scholarships and without scholarships, do they show up the least for the appointment?
>> 3. What impact can the gender of the patient have on whether or not he will attend the appointment?
>> 4. In which month is the absence rate the highest?

## Conclusions
> We can finally draw the following conclusions:

>> 1: The youngest patients are generally those who do not show up for their appointments.

>> 2: Patients on scholarships are generally the ones who show up the most for their appointments.

>> 3: The female group has a slightly higher absentee percentage than the male group.

>> 4: The month of May records the highest no-show rate.

> Our analysis may have limitations including the following:

>> The rest of the columns like that of Neighborhood do not seem to us to have an impact when it comes to the presence or absence of a patient at his or her appointment.

>> The inability to be able to give precise information about the probability that a scheduled patient will show up for their appointment.
